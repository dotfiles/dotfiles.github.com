# GitHub ❤ `~/`

Why would I want my dotfiles on GitHub?

* **_Backup_**, **_restore_**, and **_sync_** the prefs and settings for your
toolbox. Your dotfiles might be the most important files on your machine.
* **_Learn_** from the community. Discover new tools for your toolbox and new
tricks for the ones you already use.
* **_Share_** what you've learned with the rest of us.

## Get started with a bootstrap

If you're just starting out, before you go symlinking everything in `~/*`,
you may want to check out a few bootstrap projects that take the heavy lifting
out of the process. Here are a few of our favorites:

## Go further with a framework

For a lot of us, a big chunk of our `~` folder is devoted to our shell and
our text editor. Until you're ready to roll your own setup, these projects make
customization safe and easy.

### Shells

* [Liquid Prompt](https://github.com/nojhan/liquidprompt) is a full-featured and carefully designed adaptive prompt for Bash and ZSH.

#### Bash

* [bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it) is a "shameless ripoff of oh-my-zsh," but for bash.

#### Fish

* [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) A package manager for the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com).

It will automatically clone repositories containing the plugins you're using without you having to manually create submodules or clones, and supports using [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) plugins and themes as well as ones published as separate repositories.
* [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi) makes it easy to manage your dotfiles across multiple machines, securely.
* [dotzsh](https://github.com/dotphiles/dotzsh) strives to be platform and version independent, some functionality may be lost when running under older versions of ZSH, but it should degrade cleanly and allow you to use the same setup on multiple machines of differing OS's without problems.

* [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) is a lightweight plugin manager for ZSH inspired by Antigen. The goal is to have a minimal overhead when starting up the shell because nobody likes waiting. Zgen will also automatically handle cloning repositories for plugins you're using without you manually maintaining submodules or clones, and can use oh-my-zsh formatted plugins and themes.
* [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) is a next-generation plugin manager for ZSH. There is more to a ZSH plugin manager than increasing its speed. Also, there is nothing that zplug cannnot do.

* [dotfiles.sh](https://github.com/wking/dotfiles-framework) by Trevor King. Dotfiles.sh manages multiple [dotfile repositories](https://github.com/wking/dotfiles-public) so you can keep your public and private configuration separate.

* [Home Manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager) by Robert Helgesson is a system built for managing [NixOS](https://nixos.org) user environments using the [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) package manager and the [Nixpkgs](https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/) libraries.

### Tutorials

* Anish Athalye wrote a [guide on dotfiles management](http://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/) highlighting organizational approaches, installation tools, and general tips and tricks.
* Wes Bos has a series of [free videos](https://commandlinepoweruser.com/) introducing ZSH, oh-my-zsh, and z.
* Dries Vints wrote [an extensive blog post](https://driesvints.com/blog/getting-started-with-dotfiles/) on why and how he created [his dotfiles](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles).
* Michael J. Smalley wrote a [popular blog post](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/) with an associated [git repo](https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles) that includes a dotfiles installer script.
* Rosco Kalis wrote an article about [setting up dotfiles](https://kalis.me/dotfiles-automating-macos-system-configuration/), and a second one specifically about his [automated repository management](https://kalis.me/increasing-development-productivity-repository-management/).

## Don't ignore your `.gitignore`

GitHub has a great [collection of `.gitignore` templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore) for a wide range of languages and editors. We recommend Simon Whitaker's [gitignore-boilerplates](https://github.com/simonwhitaker/gibo) to help you manage them.

## Embrace submodules / subtrees

Consider using [Git submodules](https://help.github.com/submodules/) as you
start to add 3<sup>rd</sup> party frameworks, scripts, and plugins. Submodules make
managing dotfile dependencies so much easier.

If you get fed up with submodules, many people prefer
[git-subtree](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/subtree/git-subtree.txt),
which lets you merge subtrees (other repositories) into one Git repository, and
later split and push changes back out.

## FAQ

### Why create this site?

Some of your [fellow GitHub friends](https://github.com/dotfiles) have
found incredible value in digging through Other People's Dotfiles
(OPD). We aim to share that knowledge with you, our fellow wayfaring
stranger in the shell.

### You totally need to know about a great bootstrap or framework, how do I submit?

Great! We're always looking for new projects to follow. Please submit a PR or an Issue.

### Oh no! I've committed passwords/API keys/other sensitive data!

We've got you covered! Take a look at the [sensitive data removal
guide](https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data/).

### Your FAQ is weak. It *so* did not answer my question.

That's not a question. But feel free to [ask us anything on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/octodots), or to create an issue on this repository. Maybe we can expand this list.
