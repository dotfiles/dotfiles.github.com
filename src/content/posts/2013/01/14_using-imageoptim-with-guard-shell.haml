  For the uninitiated, [ImageOptim][imageoptim] is a great Mac app that uses
  several well-known image optimization tools to compress images and help keep
  file sizes down and [Guard][guard] is "a command line tool to easily handle
  events on file system modifications." If you've never tried Guard, I'd
  encourage you to take some time and check it out. With over [150
  plugins][guardplugins] now available, there's surely some way that you can
  use it to optimize your workflow.

  I like to pair the [guard-shell][guardshell] gem with ImageOptim to help me
  keep my project's image assets compressed and ready for production. Make sure
  you have both guard and guard-shell in your Gemfile and set up a watcher in
  your Guardfile for new or edited images:

  <script src="https://gist.github.com/4503714.js"></script>

  An interesting side effect to note is that guard will catch the file change
  when ImageOptim is done compressing and re-open it in ImageOptim and continue
  this loop untill there's nothing else ImageOptim can compress out of the
  image.
