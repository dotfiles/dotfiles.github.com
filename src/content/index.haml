  Why would I want my dotfiles on GitHub?

  * **_Backup_**, **_restore_**, and **_sync_** the prefs and settings for your
  toolbox. Your dotfiles might be the most important files on your machine.
  * **_Learn_** from the community. Discover new tools for your toolbox and new
  tricks for the ones you already use.
  * **_Share_** what you've learned with the rest of us.

  ## Get started with a bootstrap

  If you're just starting out, before you go symlinking everything in `~/*`,
  you may want to check out a few bootstrap projects that take the heavy lifting
  out of the process. Here are a few of our favorites:

  * [Zach Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) features
  topical organization, auto sourcing Zsh files, easy Zsh completion
  extensions, and a local bin folder for executables. The included `Rakefile` will
  symlink anything ending in `.symlink` to your `~` folder.
  * [Mathias Bynens' dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)
  includes a bootstrap script that rsyncs your repo to your home folder.
  Mathias' [OS X defaults
  script](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx) is
  legendary.
  * [Yan Pritzker's dotfiles](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles) bundles an
  opinionated set of Vim plugins and Zsh setup all tuned for using
  [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) on OS X.
  * [Josh Nichols' Homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick)
  makes it easy to symlink and clone dotfiles repos.
  * [Ben Alman's dotfiles](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles) support
  different configurations per OS, linking, copying and environment setup.

  ## Go farther with a framework

  For a lot of us, a big chunk of our `~` folder is devoted to our shell and
  our text editor. Until you're ready to roll your own setup, these projects make
  customization safe and easy.

  * [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is a
  community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration. It bundles
  40+ plugins and 80+ themes.
  * [bash-it](https://github.com/revans/bash-it)
  is a "shameless ripoff of oh-my-zsh," but for bash.
  * [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) is a distribution of plug-ins
  and mappings for Vim, Gvim and MacVim.
  * [Brandon Philip's ghar](https://github.com/philips/ghar) is a standalone
  Python script for managing git repos symlinked into your home.

  ## Don't ignore your `.gitignore`

  GitHub has a [great collection of `.gitignore` templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
  for a wide range of languages and editors. We recommend
  [Simon Whitaker's shell script](https://github.com/simonwhitaker/gitignore-boilerplates)
  to help you manage them.
