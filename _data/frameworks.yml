  name: zgenom
  notes: is a lightweight plugin manager for ZSH that is a superset of zgen. It provides
    simple commands for managing plugins. It clones and installs your plugins and
    generates a static init script that will source them for you every time you run
    the shell. We do this to save some startup time by not having to execute time
    consuming logic (plugin checking, updates, etc) every time a new shell session
    is started. While this means that you have to manually check for updates (zgenom
    update) and reset the init script (zgenom reset) whenever you add or remove plugins,
    it lets us have a minimal overhead when starting up the shell because nobody likes
    waiting. Zgenom can use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
    and [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) compliant plugins and themes.

  notes: is a lightweight plugin manager for ZSH inspired by Antigen. The goal is
    to have a minimal overhead when starting up the shell because nobody likes waiting.
    Zgen will also automatically handle cloning repositories for plugins you're using
    without you manually maintaining submodules or clones, and can use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
    and [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) compliant plugins and themes.
    zgen is no longer being maintained, we recommend switching to use the [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom)
    fork.
