  name: symly
  notes: is a utility for centralizing sparse file trees with symbolic links. It replicates
    and maintains a file tree structure of one or more repository layers into a directory)
    by creating symbolic links. For the dotfile management use case, the directory
    would be the user's home. Repositories are combined in an overriding fashion similar
    to what is done by OverlayFS. There is no database; the filesystem is the state!
    Finally, symly only focuses on managing the symbolic links but does not focus
    on backup and synchronization. You can therefore rely on your preferred tool for
    the job (rsync, git, Dropbox, Tresorit, ...)
